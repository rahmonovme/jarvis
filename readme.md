# J.A.R.V.I.S

**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System**  
An advanced AI personal assistant powered by Google Gemini Live API with real-time voice interaction, smart task execution, multi-monitor awareness, and voice-activated wake word detection.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🗣️ Real-Time Voice Interaction
- Full-duplex audio: listen and speak simultaneously
- Gemini Live API integration for natural conversation
- Audio echo cancellation: mic auto-mutes during JARVIS playback to prevent feedback loops
- **Multi-language support** — select your spoken language at boot (Uzbek, Turkish, English, etc.)
- Latin-script transcription enforcement for non-Latin languages

### 😴 Sleep & Wake Mode
- **One-click sleep** — moon button in header disconnects AI and minimizes the window
- **Voice-activated wake** — say "wake up" to restore the window and reconnect
- Lightweight wake-word listener using Google Speech Recognition (no API quota consumed)
- Automatic session reconnection after wake

### 🧠 Smart Task Execution (Agent System)
- Multi-step task planning with Gemini-powered planner
- Error recovery with auto-replanning
- **Multi-strategy app launcher** — tries direct subprocess, PATH, Windows Registry, Start Menu shortcuts before falling back to Windows Search with process verification
- Screen verification after critical actions (verifies apps actually launched)
- Multi-monitor awareness for screen analysis and interaction
- Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux out of the box.

### 🖥️ Premium Web-Native HUD Interface
- High-performance glassmorphism UI rendered via WebViews (Flask backend).
- Arc-Reactor inspired JARVIS voice visualizer (cyan, circular).
- Frequency-bar circle microphone visualizer (amber).
- **Connection status indicators** — center animation changes color:
  - 🟣 **Violet** = Idle
  - 🟦 **Cyan** = Processing
  - 💜 **Lavender** = Speaking
  - 🟡 **Amber** = Connecting
  - 🟠 **Orange** = Reconnecting
  - 🔴 **Red** = Connection Failed
  - 🌙 **Dim Violet** = Sleeping
- Animated grid, scanline, rotating arcs, and pulse rings
- Corner HUD data readouts (uptime, system status)
- Real-time clock display

### ⚙️ Desktop Deployment & Settings
- **Compiled Binary Support** — Full support for headless execution and `.exe` auto-boot pipelines.
- **Settings modal** with:
  - API key management (view/hide/edit/save)
  - Auto-start with system boot toggle
- First-launch API key setup wizard.

### 🧠 Advanced Quota & Error Management
- **Intelligent API Fallback** — Instant failsafe routing across parallel Google Quota limits to prevent daily exhaustion.
- **Local Tracker Cache** — Permanently skips exhausted endpoints using physical local JSON tracking.
- Exponential backoff on connection failures (3s → 60s cap).
- Graceful handling of WebSocket keep-alive network errors.

### 📱 Smart Messaging & Media
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram direct messaging
- pyperclip integration for Unicode contact names
- Platform-specific contact search patterns
- **YouTube controller** — play, search, summarize, trending, and open saved playlists/library

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Install Python (If you don't have it)

If your machine does not already have Python installed, you must install the bare minimum system Python to run the automated setup script.

**🍎 For macOS:**
1. Open Terminal and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Python 3:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   ```

**🪟 For Windows:**
1. Download the official installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **CRITICAL**: When running the installer, you **must** check the box at the very bottom that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"** before clicking Install.

**🐧 For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
1. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

### 2.1. Setup J.A.R.V.I.S for Windows

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmonovme/J.A.R.V.I.S.git
   ```

2. **Enter the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd J.A.R.V.I.S
   ```

3. **Run the automated setup script:** *(This automatically downloads Python 3.12 via uv if needed, creates a venv, and installs dependencies)*
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment (PowerShell):**
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

5. **Run JARVIS:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### 2.2. Setup J.A.R.V.I.S for Mac/Linux

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmonovme/J.A.R.V.I.S.git
   ```

2. **Enter the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd J.A.R.V.I.S
   ```

3. **Run the automated setup script:** *(This automatically downloads Python 3.12 via uv if needed, creates a venv, and installs dependencies)*
   ```bash
   python3 setup.py
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Run JARVIS:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## 📱 Cross-Device Mobile Architecture
JARVIS features a natively engineered, highly secure Mobile Handoff protocol, allowing you to seamlessly control your Desktop base-station from your iOS or Android smartphone over your local Wi-Fi network.

* **Dual-Bind Security:** JARVIS establishes two separate Application servers. The primary Host interface strictly locks to `127.0.0.1:5050` (Localhost TCP), fundamentally neutralizing remote Desktop vulnerabilities. 
* **Native HTTPS Tunnel:** The Mobile Assistant Mode dynamically auto-generates ephemeral Self-Signed SSL Certificates (`cryptography`), forcefully upgrading your remote connection to an active `https://` proxy on Port `5051`. This categorically bypasses Apple iOS Safari's local-network WebRTC blocks, granting you native, flag-free hardware Microphone functionality right on your iPhone or iPad!
* **Seamless Hardware Handoff:** Whenever your phone connects, the laptop's speakers are electronically locked out (`mobile_locked`). Audio and text simultaneously sync to the mobile buffer. If your phone battery dies or the screen locks, JARVIS detects the socket break within 3 seconds, instantly routes audio back to your laptop, and physically swaps the Wake-Listener to the host desktop microphone without dropping the session!
* **Active Hardware Noise Gating:** A powerful `speech_recognition` Linear Interpolation framework mathematical strips 48kHz mobile audio to pure 16kHz for Gemini, while aggressively gating active ambient static, distant traffic, and low-volume room music dynamically *before* hitting the cloud.
